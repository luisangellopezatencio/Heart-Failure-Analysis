The dataset contains medical records of 299 patients who suffered heart failure during a follow-up period.

The 13 clinical characteristics included in the dataset are:

- Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): CPK enzyme level in the blood (mcg/L)
- Diabetes: whether the patient has diabetes (boolean)
- Ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart with each contraction (percentage)
- Platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
- Sex: female or male (binary)
- Serum creatinine: serum creatinine level in the blood (mg/dL)
- Serum sodium: serum sodium level in the blood (mEq/L)
- Smoking: whether the patient smokes or not (boolean)
